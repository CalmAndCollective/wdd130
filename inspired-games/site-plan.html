        Information about our games

        Game title Elaborate Tales
        Elaborate Tales is our upcoming game. The game offers a unique approach to 
        talking to characters in video games. You can go into the characterâ€™s mind
        and alter their memories or just live their experiences. You never know 
        what goes on in people's minds. Sometimes it's peaceful, sometimes it's a 
        monster chasing you endlessly. Can you survive the Elaborate Tales from the
        people of Cailm Land? 

        Game title Coordination Correction
        Coordination Correction is a unique take on the puzzle solving experience. 
        This 8-bit like game has you on your tippy toes when trying to solve complex 
        puzzles and take back the crimson gem you rightfully deserve. Which was taken 
        from you at the start of the game. While either being chased down, about to 
        be eaten by monsters, or having a small amount of time to solve a puzzle 
        efore you get sucked in by a black hole; Can you solve these puzzles before 
        these horrible things happen to you?

        To download Coordination Correction visit the download page or click here 

        Game title Relentless Running
        Relentless Runng is oniur first game Inspired Games has released. It is 
        simply a scrolling platform game where your green outlined, pink dude is 
        running away from a monster that is trying to fill its belly. Can you outwit 
        this monster that you have accidentally awoken from its 1000 year slumber 
        and is now hungry?

        What we anticipate to do in the future for the Inspired Games Website.

        In the future we hope to add video teaser trailers for our games along 
        with our teaser images. We want to add more pages like a future merch 
        store for our most dedicated fans, and an endorsement page on what the 
        influencers, streamers, and gamers have to say about our games.
