                    Elaborate Tales is our upcoming game. The game offers a unique approach to 
                    talking to characters in video games. You can go into the character's mind
                    and alter their memories or just live their experiences. You never know 
                    what goes on in people's minds. Sometimes it's peaceful, sometimes it's a 
                    monster chasing you endlessly. Can you survive the Elaborate Tales from the
                    people of Cailm Land?

                    <hr>
                    <p>We are a small indie game studio company that is passionate about making unique,
                        high pace action video 
                        games. Since we are small, we only have two games available for download
                        right now (check out the download page for more information) and one 
                        game, Elaborate Tales, coming out soon. We anticipate having more games 
                        come out in the future. When new games come out this website will be 
                        the first place to see what the games are all about. </p>

                    <h4>What we anticipate to do in the future for the Inspired Games Website.</h4>
                    <p> In the future we hope to add video teaser trailers for our games along 
                        with our teaser images. We want to add more pages like a future merch 
                        store for our most dedicated fans, and an endorsement page on what the 
                        influencers, streamers, and gamers have to say about our games.</p>
