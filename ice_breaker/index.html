    <h2>Nick Name Ben Wilson</h2>
    <p>Hello I'm Ben Wilson from Boise, ID. I've been a member of the Church for my entire life.</p>
    <p>
        One of my favorite scriptures is <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/109?lang=eng&id=p7#p7"> D&C 109:7</a>
        Becuase it teaches me to learn as much as I can in life.
        That makes very convenient for me becuase I love to learn about lots of things.
        
    </p>
    <p>I'm very excited to be learning how to make websites. Even tho were only in week one, I now appreciate other websites and the amount of time the person or team puts into it.</p>
